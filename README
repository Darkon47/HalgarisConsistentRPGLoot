Running synthesis with this mod the first time will generate two .json files.

ArmorSettings.json
WeaponSettings.json

You can use these to customize what it will do when you run Synthesis again.

json value definitions:
LLEntries: This works as the odds that a specific rarity will be created.
	When UseRNGRarities = true this will be randomized, and work as a chance value.
	When it's false this will define how many varieties of this rarity will be created
		Formula: (LLEntries / AllEntriesForAllItems)* VarietyCountPerItem
NumEnchantments: The number of enchantments used to define a rarity...i.e. 1 enchantment is fairly balanced...4 probably not so much
Label: Added to each generated item's name
UseRNGRarities: Should the number of varieties per item be randomly selected, or the same for all items? (it is possible to get none of some rarities or all of others, even an even spread)
VarietyCountPerItem: Number of varieties per base item, this will be constant and split among the varieties described.
